- `core/` - Old core directory (moved to `src/ronin/core/`)
- `services/` - Old services directory (moved to `src/ronin/services/`)
- `models/` - Old models directory (moved to `src/ronin/models/`)
- `utils/` - Old utils directory (moved to `src/ronin/utils/`)
- `configs/` - Old configs directory (moved to `src/ronin/core/`)
- `blocks/` - Unused blocks directory
- `flows/` - Unused flows directory
- `outreach/` - Empty outreach directory
- `tests/` - Minimal tests directory

### ❌ **Removed Redundant Files**

- Old shell scripts (`run_*.sh`, `manage_books.py`, etc.)
- Old test files (`test_*.py`)
- Old documentation files
- Old README (replaced with new structure README)
- Root `__init__.py` file

### **1. Setup (One Time)**

```bash
make setup
```

### **2. Run Automation**

```bash
make search     # Search for jobs
make apply      # Apply to jobs
make blog       # Generate blog posts
make book       # Scrape book content
make all        # Run everything
```

### **3. Development**

```bash
make format     # Format code
make lint       # Lint code
make check      # Format + lint
make clean      # Clean up
make test       # Test structure
```
