Bluefin Recruitment,

I’m a senior data engineer with 6 years of professional experience and 13+ years of deep SQL fluency. I’ve delivered full-stack solutions across Snowflake, Databricks, AWS, and Azure—migrating legacy systems, building warehouse layers, and productionising analytical models.

Key highlights:

- Built secure ingestion and ELT pipelines for a government healthcare platform using SQL Server, Oracle, S3, Snowflake, and dbt.

- Designed end-to-end DAGs in Matillion and dbt for DIM-FACT warehouse layers. Automated CI/CD via Azure DevOps.

- Rebuilt cloud architecture post-botched migrations. Untangled spaghetti infra and led DevOps enablement across teams.

- Proficient in Python, Bash, PowerShell, Docker, Git. Strong on Linux/Windows hybrid ops. Certifications in AWS, Snowflake, and Databricks.

I know how to spot weak pipelines, kill scope bloat, and ship production-ready data systems. If your client needs someone to cut through the mess and deliver—bring me in.
