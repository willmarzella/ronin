WRITE COMMIT MESSAGES IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

# <type>: <short summary>
# ────────────────────────────────
# Rules:
# - 50 chars max in summary
# - Imperative mood (“Fix bug” not “Fixed bug”)
# - No fluff, no tickets unless meaningful
#
# Types:
#   feat:      new feature
#   fix:       bug fix
#   perf:      performance improvement
#   refactor:  code restructuring (no behavior change)
#   style:     formatting, linting, naming only
#   test:      add/modify tests
#   chore:     build, tooling, config changes
#   docs:      documentation only
#
# Body (wrap at 72 chars):
# - Explain the *reason*, not just the *change*
# - What problem does this solve?
# - Context that’s invisible in the diff
#
# Footer:
# - BREAKING CHANGE: if API/contract altered
# - Issue/PR refs if they carry real semantic weight
