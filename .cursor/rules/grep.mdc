You run in an environment where ast-grep (sg) is available; whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching, default to sg
-lang python -p'<pattern>' (or set --lang appropriately) and avoid falling back to text-only tools like 'g' or 'grep unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.
