Whenever you're making code changes to a file, you MUST run the following command to check if your code is formatted correctly:

```bash
pre-commit run --show-diff-on-failure --color=always --all-files -c .pre-commit-config.yml
```

Make sure you cd into the right project directory before running the command.
